// In the functions.test.ts file, there is a describe block waiting for tests!

// Write at least 2 tests in the describe callback for the shuffleArray function. You may need to read through Jest documentation to find methods/matchers to use.

// Some ideas:

// check that shuffleArray returns an array

// check that it returns an array of the same length as the argument sent in

// check that all the same items are in the array

// check that the items have been shuffled around

// Once youâ€™re done, make sure your server is running with nodemon.

// Next, in a new terminal window while your server is still running, run the tests with npm run test. You should see 1 passed in green when this command runs.
